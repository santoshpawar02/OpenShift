Kubernetes and Containers: Kubernetes manages containerized applications through a concept called pods, which can contain one or multiple containers. Pods are the basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes.

Deploying Applications: 

You can deploy applications using the kubectl command-line tool.
The run command creates a pod with a specified name and image.
You can also use manifest files (YAML or JSON) to define resources, which can be generated using kubectl create.
Difference Between Commands:

kubectl create attempts to create a resource and fails if it already exists.
kubectl apply tries to create the resource but will modify it if it already exists.
Executing Commands in Pods: The kubectl exec command allows you to run commands inside a pod, which is useful for debugging.
This lecture sets the stage for deploying applications in Kubernetes, emphasizing the importance of understanding pods and the commands used for deployment.

<!--          differences between kubectl create and kubectl apply           -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Purpose:

kubectl create: This command is used to create a new resource in the Kubernetes cluster. If the resource already exists, the command will fail.
kubectl apply: This command is used to create a resource if it does not exist, or to update it if it does. It modifies the existing resource based on the provided manifest.
Behavior:

kubectl create: Fails if the resource already exists, indicating that the resource cannot be created again.
kubectl apply: If the resource exists, it updates the resource according to the new definition provided in the manifest.
Use Case:
kubectl create: Best used when you are sure that the resource does not exist and you want to create it.
kubectl apply: Ideal for managing resources over time, as it allows for both creation and updates without needing to check if the resource exists first.
These differences are crucial for effective resource management in Kubernetes.
