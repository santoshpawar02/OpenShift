<!--                   Source-to-Image (S2I) in simple way                   -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool that simplifies the process of building container images from source code. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

Start with Your Code: You have your application code stored in a repository (like Git).

Choose a Builder Image: S2I uses a "builder image" that contains the necessary tools and libraries to compile and run your application. For example, if you're building a Node.js app, you would use a Node.js builder image.

Build the Image:

S2I takes your source code and the builder image and combines them.
It compiles your code and packages it into a new container image.
Run the Application: Once the image is built, you can run it in a container. This image contains everything needed to run your application, including the code, libraries, and runtime environment.
Key Benefits:

Automation: S2I automates the build process, making it easier and faster to create container images.
Consistency: It ensures that the same environment is used for building and running the application, reducing issues related to environment differences.
Simplicity: Developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying containerization process.
In summary, S2I streamlines the process of turning your application code into a runnable container image, making it easier for developers to deploy their applications.
