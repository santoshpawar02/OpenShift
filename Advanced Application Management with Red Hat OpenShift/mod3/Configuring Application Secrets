secrets and configuration maps in the context of cloud-native applications, particularly within Kubernetes and OpenShift. Here are the key points:

Externalizing Configuration: It's important to separate application configuration from the source code to allow the same code to run in different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) with different settings (like databases or credentials).

Configuration Maps vs. Secrets:

Configuration Maps: Store non-sensitive data in plain text.
Secrets: Store sensitive data in base64 encoded format, which allows for larger files (up to 1 MB) but is not cryptographically secure by default.
Usage: Both configuration maps and secrets can be injected into applications as environment variables or mounted as files, allowing applications to access necessary configurations at runtime without hardcoding sensitive information.

Security Considerations: While secrets are encoded, they are not inherently secure unless additional encryption is enabled in the underlying storage (ETCD).
This lecture emphasizes the importance of managing application configurations securely and effectively to ensure smooth deployments across various environments.

<!--   Example: Managing Application Configuration in a Cloud Environment    -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Scenario: You are working on a cloud-native application that needs to connect to different databases depending on the environment (development, testing, production).

Using Config Maps:

You create a config map to store non-sensitive configuration data, such as the database connection string for the development environment.
This config map might look like this in a YAML file:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: dev-config
data:
  DATABASE_URL: "jdbc:mysql://dev-db.example.com:3306/mydb"
When your application runs in the development environment, it retrieves this configuration at runtime, ensuring that the same code can be deployed across different environments without hardcoding values.
Using Secrets:
For sensitive information, such as database credentials, you create a secret to store this data securely.
The secret might look like this:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  username: bXlVc2Vy  # base64 encoded value
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # base64 encoded value
Your application can access these secrets at runtime, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed in your source code or version control systems like GitHub.
Relevance to Your Career:

Separation of Concerns: By using config maps and secrets, you are practicing a key principle in DevOps: separating configuration from code. This allows for more flexible and secure deployments.
Confidence in Deployments: Knowing that the same code works across different environments boosts your confidence in deploying updates frequently, which is essential in a DevOps role.
Security Best Practices: Understanding how to manage sensitive information securely is crucial for any systems engineer transitioning to DevOps.

<!--           How can you securely manage secrets in Kubernetes?            -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
To securely manage secrets in Kubernetes, consider the following best practices:

Use Kubernetes Secrets:

Store sensitive information like passwords, tokens, and SSH keys in Kubernetes Secrets instead of hardcoding them in your application code.
Enable Encryption at Rest:

Configure Kubernetes to encrypt secrets stored in etcd (the underlying database) to protect them from unauthorized access.
Limit Access with RBAC:

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict who can access and manage secrets. Only grant permissions to users and applications that absolutely need them.
Use External Secret Management Tools:

Integrate with external secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault for enhanced security and management capabilities.
Avoid Exposing Secrets in Logs:

Ensure that your application does not log sensitive information. Review logging configurations to prevent accidental exposure of secrets.
Regularly Rotate Secrets:

Implement a process for regularly rotating secrets to minimize the risk of exposure. Update your applications to use the new secrets without downtime.
Use Network Policies:

Apply network policies to restrict communication between pods, ensuring that only authorized services can access the secrets.
Monitor and Audit Access:
Enable auditing in Kubernetes to track access to secrets and monitor for any unauthorized attempts to access sensitive information.

<!--              use Application Secrets to manage an API key               -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
use Application Secrets to manage an API key  for a weather application that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API. Here’s a brief summary of the key steps involved:

API Key Generation: Create an account on OpenWeatherMap and generate an API key.
Application Overview: The application fetches weather data based on user input (city name) and displays it.
Configuration Maps and Secrets: Use the OpenShift web console to create configuration maps and secrets to store the API key and other settings.
Deployment: Update the deployment configuration to include the created secrets and config maps, allowing the application to access the API key securely.
Testing: After deployment, test the application to ensure it retrieves and displays weather data correctly.
Configuration Changes: Learn how to modify configuration properties (like units of measurement) and understand how to propagate these changes by scaling the pods.
This exercise emphasizes the importance of securely managing sensitive information and effectively deploying applications in OpenShift.

<!--       What happens when you change the configuration map's units?       -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

When you change the configuration map's units in your OpenShift application, the following occurs:

Update the ConfigMap: You modify the value of the units key in the configuration map (e.g., changing from metric to imperial).

Pod Environment Variables: The environment variables for the running pods are set at the time of their creation. Therefore, simply updating the configuration map does not automatically change the environment variables for existing pods.

Pod Restart Required: To apply the new configuration, you need to restart the pods. This can be done by:

Scaling the pod down to zero and then back up.
Scaling the pod to a different number (e.g., from 1 to 2, then back to 1).
New Pods with Updated Config: When the pods are recreated, they will read the updated configuration map, and the new value for units will be injected as an environment variable.

Application Behavior: After the pods are restarted, the application will now use the new unit setting (e.g., displaying temperatures in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius).

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!--       How does the application read the configuration map values?       -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

The application reads the configuration map values through environment variables that are set during the deployment process. Here’s how it works:

Configuration Map Creation: You create a configuration map in OpenShift, which contains key-value pairs (e.g., units: metric).

Deployment Configuration: When deploying the application, you specify that certain environment variables should be populated from the configuration map. For example:

Set an environment variable named UNITS to take its value from the configuration map weather-config with the key units.
Pod Creation: When the pods are created, OpenShift injects the values from the configuration map into the specified environment variables. This happens at the time of pod creation.

Application Code: In your application code (e.g., in Node.js), you can access these environment variables using process.env. For example:

const units = process.env.UNITS; // This retrieves the value of the UNITS environment variable
Using the Values: The application can then use these values to determine how to process data or display information (e.g., whether to show temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit).

<!--     Example: Deploying a Weather Application in a Cloud Environment     -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Scenario: Imagine you are part of a DevOps team responsible for deploying a weather application that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This application allows users to input a city name and receive current weather data.

Using Application Secrets:

You need to keep your API key secure. Instead of hardcoding it into your application code, you create a secret in your cloud environment (like OpenShift) to store the API key.
This way, the API key is not exposed in your codebase, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Using Configuration Maps:

The application requires a configuration setting for the units of measurement (e.g., metric or imperial). You create a configuration map to manage this setting.
By using a configuration map, you can easily change the units from metric to imperial without modifying the application code. This flexibility allows for quick adjustments based on user preferences.
Deployment Process:

You use the OpenShift web console to create the secret and configuration map.
When deploying the application, you reference the secret and configuration map in your deployment configuration, ensuring that the application has access to the necessary environment variables at runtime.
Benefits:
Security: Sensitive information like API keys is stored securely.
Flexibility: Configuration settings can be changed without redeploying the application.
Efficiency: Streamlined deployment process using cloud-native tools.
