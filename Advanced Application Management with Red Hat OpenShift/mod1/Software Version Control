#     version control, particularly in the context of software engineering.    #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

Definition: Version control allows you to manage and track changes to files, especially source code.
Key Features:
Review and Restore: Ability to review previous versions and restore them if needed.
Change Comparison: Compare different versions to identify changes made by collaborators.
Change Log: Maintain a log of who made changes and when, which is useful for troubleshooting.
Collaboration: Support for multiple users working on the same files and resolving conflicts.
Git: The course will use Git, a popular open-source version control system, distinguishing it from platforms like GitHub or GitLab, which host repositories remotely.
Basic Workflow:
Clone: Download a repository and its history.
Commit: Save changes with a message and metadata.
Push/Pull: Synchronize local changes with the remote repository and retrieve updates from others.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

Scenario: Imagine you are part of a team developing a new application for a client. Each team member is responsible for different features of the application.

Version Control in Action:

Cloning the Repository: You start by cloning the main repository from GitHub to your local machine. This gives you access to the entire project history and the latest code.

Making Changes: You work on a new feature, say a user authentication module. As you code, you make several changes and test them locally.

Committing Changes: Once you are satisfied with your work, you create a commit with a clear message describing what you’ve done, like "Implemented user login functionality." This commit includes a timestamp and your author information, making it easy for others to see who made the change and when.

Pushing Changes: After committing, you push your changes to the remote repository. This makes your feature available to the rest of the team.

Pulling Updates: While you were working, another team member added a new feature to the same file. Before you can push your changes, you need to pull the latest updates from the remote repository to ensure you have the most recent code.

Resolving Conflicts: If there are conflicting changes (e.g., both you and your colleague modified the same line), Git will notify you. You’ll need to manually resolve these conflicts by deciding which changes to keep or how to merge them.
Benefits:
Collaboration: This process allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
History Tracking: You can always revert to previous versions of the code if something goes wrong, ensuring that you can recover from mistakes easily.
Accountability: The commit history provides a clear log of who made changes and when, which is essential for accountability in a team environment.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
Source Control Management (SCM): VS Code has a source control view that can be enabled to manage Git repositories effectively.
Single Git Repository: The course will primarily use one Git repository.
Cloning Repositories: You can clone a Git repository using the command palette in VS Code by entering the remote URL.
File Status: Git tracks files in two stages modified (changes made) and staged (ready for the next commit).
Creating Commits: After staging files, you can create a commit with a message, which is stored in your local repository.
Synchronizing Changes: To push local commits to a remote repository, you need to authenticate, typically using a GitHub access token.
Initializing Repositories: You can initialize a new local Git repository, which can later be linked to a remote repository.

#          implications of using HTTPS vs SSH for Git authentication?          #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
Using HTTPS and SSH for Git authentication has different implications:

HTTPS:

Ease of Use: Generally easier to set up, especially for beginners. You just need a username and password (or a personal access token).
Firewall Friendly: Works well in environments with strict firewall rules, as it uses standard HTTPS ports (80 and 443).
Credential Management: You may need to enter your credentials frequently unless you use a credential manager.
SSH:

Security: Provides a more secure method of authentication through key pairs (public and private keys).
No Passwords: Once set up, you don’t need to enter your credentials for each operation, making it more convenient for frequent use.
Initial Setup Complexity: Requires generating SSH keys and adding the public key to your Git hosting service, which can be more complex for beginners.
Summary:

HTTPS is simpler and more straightforward, while SSH offers enhanced security and convenience for regular users. The choice depends on your comfort level with setup and your security needs.

Install Git: 

On Unix-based systems like Ubuntu, use the apt package manager.
On Fedora, use DNF.
On MacOS, check if Git is pre-installed using git --version.
For Windows, visit Git SCM to install.
Configure Git: 

Set your username and email using git config --global user.name and git config --global user.email.
Initialize a Local Git Repository: 

Use Visual Studio Code to initialize your project directory as a Git repository.
Stage and Commit Files: 

Stage files you want to include in your commit and create a commit.
Push to a Remote Repository:
Create a repository on GitHub, generate a personal access token for authentication, and push your local commits to the remote repository.
This exercise emphasizes the importance of version control and how to manage your code effectively using Git and GitHub.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Scenario: Imagine you are part of a DevOps team working on a web application. Your team uses Git for version control to manage the codebase collaboratively.

Relevance: As a systems engineer, understanding Git is crucial for effective collaboration in software development. It allows you to track changes, manage different versions of the code, and collaborate seamlessly with your team.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Installing Git: You start by installing Git on your machine, ensuring you have the necessary tools to contribute to the project.

Configuring Git: You configure Git with your username and email, which helps identify your contributions in the project history.

Creating a Local Repository: You clone the team's repository from GitHub to your local machine, allowing you to work on the codebase.

Making Changes: You add a new feature to the application. After coding, you stage the changes using Git, indicating which files are ready to be committed.

Committing Changes: You create a commit with a clear message describing the new feature, which helps your team understand what changes were made.

Pushing to GitHub: Finally, you push your commit to the remote repository on GitHub. This makes your changes available to the entire team, allowing them to review and integrate your work.
Outcome: By using Git and GitHub, you enhance collaboration within your team, maintain a clear history of changes, and ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the project's progress.
