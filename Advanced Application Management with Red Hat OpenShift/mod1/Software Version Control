#     version control, particularly in the context of software engineering.    #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

Definition: Version control allows you to manage and track changes to files, especially source code.
Key Features:
Review and Restore: Ability to review previous versions and restore them if needed.
Change Comparison: Compare different versions to identify changes made by collaborators.
Change Log: Maintain a log of who made changes and when, which is useful for troubleshooting.
Collaboration: Support for multiple users working on the same files and resolving conflicts.
Git: The course will use Git, a popular open-source version control system, distinguishing it from platforms like GitHub or GitLab, which host repositories remotely.
Basic Workflow:
Clone: Download a repository and its history.
Commit: Save changes with a message and metadata.
Push/Pull: Synchronize local changes with the remote repository and retrieve updates from others.

Scenario: Imagine you are part of a team developing a new application for a client. Each team member is responsible for different features of the application.

Version Control in Action:

Cloning the Repository: You start by cloning the main repository from GitHub to your local machine. This gives you access to the entire project history and the latest code.

Making Changes: You work on a new feature, say a user authentication module. As you code, you make several changes and test them locally.

Committing Changes: Once you are satisfied with your work, you create a commit with a clear message describing what you’ve done, like "Implemented user login functionality." This commit includes a timestamp and your author information, making it easy for others to see who made the change and when.

Pushing Changes: After committing, you push your changes to the remote repository. This makes your feature available to the rest of the team.

Pulling Updates: While you were working, another team member added a new feature to the same file. Before you can push your changes, you need to pull the latest updates from the remote repository to ensure you have the most recent code.

Resolving Conflicts: If there are conflicting changes (e.g., both you and your colleague modified the same line), Git will notify you. You’ll need to manually resolve these conflicts by deciding which changes to keep or how to merge them.
Benefits:
Collaboration: This process allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
History Tracking: You can always revert to previous versions of the code if something goes wrong, ensuring that you can recover from mistakes easily.
Accountability: The commit history provides a clear log of who made changes and when, which is essential for accountability in a team environment.
