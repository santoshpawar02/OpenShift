<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Purpose of Routes: Routes enable external access to applications deployed in OpenShift, allowing users to access them via a public DNS name.

YAML/JSON Representation: The route is represented in YAML or JSON format, which includes important parameters like the route name and host (the DNS name).

Routing Mechanism: The routing is managed by a Router pod (default is HAProxy). When a route is created, traffic is directed through this Router pod to the appropriate service, which then connects to the relevant pod.

Creating Routes: Routes can be created using the OC expose command, which can expose various resources, including services. The generated DNS name follows a specific format.

Router Pod: Admins can view and manage the Router pod using commands to check its configuration and resources.

<!--          How does the Router pod manage traffic in OpenShift?           -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

The Router pod in OpenShift manages traffic through the following process:

Traffic Routing: When a request is made to a route, the Router pod (typically using HAProxy) checks if the requested hostname matches any of the defined routes.

Service Matching: If a match is found, the Router pod forwards the traffic to the corresponding service. Each service has a static IP address, which helps in managing dynamic pod IP addresses.

Pod Communication: The service then directs the traffic to one of its associated pods, which processes the request and sends back a response.

Simplified Flow: In a simplified manner, the flow can be summarized as:
Request → Router pod → Service → Pod
This mechanism allows OpenShift to efficiently manage incoming traffic and ensure that requests are routed to the correct application instances.

<!--            What is the role of the Router pod in OpenShift?             -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

The Router pod in OpenShift plays a crucial role in managing external access to applications. Here are its key functions:

Traffic Management: It routes incoming traffic from external clients to the appropriate services within the OpenShift cluster based on defined routes.

Hostname Matching: The Router pod checks the requested hostname against the routes configured in OpenShift. If a match is found, it forwards the request to the corresponding service.

Service Bridging: It bridges the gap between external DNS names and internal services, allowing users to access applications using user-friendly URLs.

Load Balancing: The Router pod can distribute incoming requests across multiple pods associated with a service, providing load balancing and improving application availability.

HAProxy Default: By default, OpenShift uses HAProxy as the Router pod, which is a robust and efficient tool for managing traffic.
These functions ensure that applications deployed in OpenShift are accessible and can handle varying levels of traffic effectively.

Routing Requests: It receives incoming requests and determines the correct service to forward them to based on the defined routes.

Hostname Resolution: The Router pod matches the requested hostname with the configured routes, ensuring that users can access applications via user-friendly URLs.

<!--            Example: Deploying a Web Application in OpenShift            -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Scenario: Imagine you are working on a web application for an e-commerce platform that needs to be accessible to customers over the internet.

Creating a Route:

You deploy your application in the OpenShift environment, but initially, it is only accessible within the cluster.
To make it available to users, you create a route using the OC expose command. This command links your application to a public DNS name, allowing external access.
Understanding the Routing Process:

When a customer types the URL into their web browser, the request is sent to the Router pod in OpenShift.
The Router pod checks the incoming request against the defined routes. If it matches the route you created for your e-commerce application, it forwards the request to the corresponding service.
The service then directs the request to the appropriate pod that runs your application, which processes the request and sends back the response to the customer.
Relevance:
This example illustrates how routes in OpenShift facilitate external access to applications, a crucial aspect of modern cloud-based application deployment.
As a systems engineer, understanding this process will enhance your skills in managing applications in a cloud environment, which is essential for your goal of becoming a DevOps engineer.
By grasping the concept of routes and their practical application, you are building a solid foundation for your career transition.

<!--          insights into routes using the OpenShift client (OC).          -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
The steps include:
Logging in to the OpenShift web console and preparing to use the OC command line.
Deploying a PHP-based application using the OC new app command with a specified Docker image.
Checking the status of the application and its logs using OC get and OC logs commands.
Verifying the service configuration and ensuring it routes requests correctly.
Creating a route for the service using the OC expose command, which generates a fully qualified domain name for accessing the application.
Modifying the route by deleting the old one and creating a new one with a different name.
This exercise emphasizes the efficiency of using the OC command line compared to the web console for managing applications in OpenShift.

<!--     Example: Deploying a Web Application for an E-commerce Business     -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Scenario: Imagine you are a systems engineer working for an e-commerce company that wants to launch a new online store. The company decides to use OpenShift to manage its applications.

Deployment Process:

You log in to the OpenShift web console and prepare to use the OC command line.
You deploy a PHP-based application that serves as the backend for the online store using the OC new app command. This application will handle product listings, user accounts, and transactions.
After deployment, you check the application’s status and logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.
Service Verification:

You verify that the service is correctly routing requests to the application. This is crucial because customers need to access the store without interruptions.
You use the OC describe command to confirm that the service has an IP address and is connected to the running application pods.
Creating a Route:

To make the application accessible to customers, you create a route using the OC expose command. This generates a user-friendly URL, such as shop.mycompany.com, allowing customers to easily access the online store.
You can also modify the route later if needed, for example, changing it to sale.mycompany.com during a promotional event.
Outcome:
The e-commerce site is now live, and customers can browse products and make purchases seamlessly. The use of OpenShift and its routing capabilities ensures that the application is scalable and can handle traffic efficiently.
