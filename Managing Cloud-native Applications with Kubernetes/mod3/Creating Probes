<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

HTTP Checks: Commonly used to check the status of applications that expose an HTTP interface, such as REST APIs. You configure a GET request with a specific path and port.
Container Execution Checks: Executes a command within the pod to verify readiness, such as running an SQL command to check database readiness.
TCP Socket Checks: Used for applications that communicate via TCP ports. It checks if a connection can be established on a specified port.
Implementation: Probes can be added to a deployment using the kubectl edit command, specifying the probe type (readiness, liveness, or startup) and its parameters.
This content sets the stage for understanding how to effectively monitor and manage applications in a Kubernetes environment.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
To implement a readiness probe in a Kubernetes deployment, you can follow these steps:

Edit the Deployment: Use the kubectl edit command to modify your deployment resource.

kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>
Add the Readiness Probe: In the container specification, add the readiness probe configuration. Here’s an example of how to configure it using an HTTP GET request:

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  timeoutSeconds: 1
httpGet: Specifies the HTTP request to check the application’s health.
path: The endpoint to check (e.g., /healthz).
port: The port on which the application is running (e.g., 8080).
initialDelaySeconds: The time to wait before performing the first check (e.g., 15 seconds).
timeoutSeconds: The time to wait for a response before considering the check failed (e.g., 1 second).
Save Changes: After adding the readiness probe configuration, save and exit the editor. Kubernetes will automatically apply the changes.
This setup ensures that the application is only marked as ready when it successfully responds to the specified HTTP request.

Real-Life Example: Monitoring a Web Application

Imagine you are a systems engineer working on a web application that provides online banking services. Ensuring that the application is always available and functioning correctly is crucial for user satisfaction and security.

HTTP Checks for Readiness Probe:

You configure a readiness probe that sends an HTTP GET request to the /healthz endpoint of your application.
This endpoint checks if the application is ready to handle requests, such as verifying database connections and ensuring that all necessary services are running.
If the readiness probe fails, Kubernetes will not route traffic to this instance of the application, preventing users from experiencing downtime.
Container Execution Checks for Liveness Probe:

You implement a liveness probe that executes a command within the container, such as running a simple SQL query like SELECT 1.
This command checks if the database is responsive. If the command fails, Kubernetes will restart the container, ensuring that the application remains available.
TCP Socket Checks:
If your application communicates over a TCP socket (for example, a messaging service), you can set up a TCP socket check.
This probe attempts to connect to a specific TCP port. If the connection is successful, the application is considered healthy; if not, Kubernetes can take action, such as restarting the pod.
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!--               implement a TCP socket check in Kubernetes?               -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

To implement a TCP socket check in Kubernetes, you can follow these steps:

Define the Probe in Your Pod Specification:
You need to specify the TCP socket check in the pod's YAML configuration file under the livenessProbe, readinessProbe, or startupProbe section.

Specify the Port: Indicate the port that the probe should check. If the probe can establish a successful connection to that port, it is considered successful.
Here’s an example of how to implement a TCP socket check in a pod specification:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: example-image
    livenessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      timeoutSeconds: 1
Key Components:

tcpSocket: This indicates that a TCP socket check is being used.
port: The port number that the probe will check (in this case, 8080).
initialDelaySeconds: The time to wait before performing the first probe after the container starts.
timeoutSeconds: The time to wait for a response before considering the probe failed.
This configuration will allow Kubernetes to check if the application is listening on the specified TCP port. If the connection can be established, the probe is successful; otherwise, it fails.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!--                 What happens if a liveness probe fails?                 -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
If a liveness probe fails in Kubernetes, the following behavior is expected:

Container Restart: Kubernetes will automatically restart the container that failed the liveness probe. This is done to recover from situations where the application is in a non-responsive state or has crashed.

Failure Count: Kubernetes keeps track of the number of consecutive failures of the liveness probe. If the probe fails a specified number of times (defined by the failureThreshold parameter), Kubernetes will take action (restart the container).

Event Logging: Kubernetes logs events related to the failure of the liveness probe, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring the health of the application.

Health Check Interval: The liveness probe is checked at regular intervals (defined by the periodSeconds parameter). If the application becomes healthy again, it will continue running without further restarts.
Example Scenario:

If a web application becomes unresponsive due to a bug or resource exhaustion, the liveness probe may fail.
Kubernetes detects the failure and restarts the container.
The application is then re-initialized, allowing it to recover from the unresponsive state.
This mechanism helps ensure that applications remain available and can recover from transient issues without manual intervention.
