Injection Methods: Config Maps and Secrets can be injected into application pods either as environment variables or by mounting them as volumes using the kubectl set command.
Config Maps: These store non-sensitive data in plaintext, while Secrets are used for sensitive information like usernames and passwords.
Choosing Between Methods:
Generally, it's preferred to inject data as environment variables.
If there is a large amount of data or if the data needs to be accessed as a file (e.g., TLS certificates), mounting as a volume is more suitable.

<!--            How can you inject Secrets into a Kubernetes pod?            -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

You can inject Secrets into a Kubernetes pod in two main ways: as environment variables or by mounting them as volumes. Here’s a brief overview of both methods:

1. Injecting as Environment Variables

Use the kubectl set env command to set environment variables from a Secret.
Example command:
kubectl set env deployment/<deployment-name> --from=secret/<secret-name>
2. Mounting as Volumes

Define a volume in your pod specification that references the Secret.
Example YAML snippet:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myimage
    volumeMounts:
    - name: mysecret-volume
      mountPath: /etc/secret
  volumes:
  - name: mysecret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: <secret-name>
In this example, the Secret is mounted at /etc/secret in the container.

<!--    advantages of using environment variables over mounting Secrets?     -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Using environment variables to inject Secrets into a Kubernetes pod has several advantages over mounting them as volumes:

Advantages of Using Environment Variables:

Simplicity: Setting environment variables is straightforward and can be done with a single command, making it easier to manage.
Immediate Access: Environment variables are readily available to the application at runtime, allowing for quick access to sensitive data.
No File Handling: There’s no need to manage files or paths, which can simplify application code and reduce the risk of file-related errors.
Isolation: Each pod can have its own set of environment variables, providing a level of isolation for sensitive data.
When to Consider Mounting Secrets:

If you have a large amount of data or need to access the data as a file (e.g., certificates).
When you want to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the application code.

<!--     decide between using environment variables or mounting volumes?     -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
Deciding between using environment variables or mounting volumes in Kubernetes depends on several factors:

Data Size:

Environment Variables: Best for small amounts of data, such as configuration settings or flags.
Volumes: More suitable for larger files, such as certificates or configuration files.
Data Type:

Environment Variables: Ideal for simple key-value pairs.
Volumes: Better for complex data structures or files that need to be accessed as files.
Application Requirements:

Environment Variables: If your application is designed to read configuration from environment variables, this method is preferable.
Volumes: If your application expects to read configuration from files, mounting a volume is the way to go.
Security Considerations:

Environment Variables: Sensitive data can be exposed in logs or process listings.
Volumes: Mounting secrets as files can provide better security practices, especially for sensitive data.
Ease of Management:
Environment Variables: Easier to manage for small configurations.
Volumes: More manageable for larger configurations or when multiple files are involved.
By considering these factors, you can make an informed decision on whether to use environment variables or mount volumes in your Kubernetes applications.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
Injecting Data as Environment Variables:

Definition: Environment variables are key-value pairs that are set in the environment of a container.
Use Case: Best for small, simple configurations or settings that the application can read at runtime.
Access: The application accesses these variables directly from the environment.
Visibility: Can be exposed in logs or process listings, which may pose security risks for sensitive data.
Example: Setting a database URL or feature flag.
Mounting Data as a Volume:

Definition: A volume is a storage resource that can be mounted into a container at a specified path.
Use Case: Ideal for larger files or complex configurations that need to be accessed as files.
Access: The application reads the data from the file system, allowing for file-based access.
Visibility: Provides better security for sensitive data, as it can be managed as files rather than exposed in the environment.
Example: Mounting a TLS certificate or a configuration file.
Summary:

Environment Variables are suitable for small, simple data, while Volumes are better for larger, file-based data. The choice depends on the specific needs of your application and the nature of the data being used.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

In this guided exercise, you will deploy a simple Express.js application using Kubernetes. The main tasks include:

Environment Variables: The application prints the value of the APP_MSG environment variable. If not set, it returns undefined.
File Reading: The app attempts to read a file (/opt/app-root/secure/myapp.sec). If the file is not mounted, it appends an error to the response.
Creating Config Maps and Secrets: You will create a ConfigMap to inject the APP_MSG variable and a Secret to manage sensitive data (like usernames and passwords).
Deployment and Ingress: The deployment is exposed via a service, and an ingress is created to allow external access.
Patching Deployment: You will patch the deployment to mount the secret as a file and verify that the application can read the secret data.
Finally, you will clean up by deleting the resources created during the exercise.
