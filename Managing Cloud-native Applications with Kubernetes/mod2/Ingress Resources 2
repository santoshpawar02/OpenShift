<!--    ingress router in a Kubernetes cluster. Here are the key points:     -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Ingress Resource: A standard Kubernetes resource that routes traffic into the cluster, defined in a YAML manifest file.
Manifest Structure:
Kind: Specifies the resource type as "ingress."
Rules Section: Contains an array of rules, each with:
Host: The domain name (e.g., hello.example.com).
Path: The specific path for routing.
Path Type: Can be either "exact" (matches the path exactly) or "prefix" (matches the path and anything following it).
Backend Configuration: Specifies where the request is routed, including the service name and port (e.g., service name "hello" on port 80).
Testing: Requests can be tested using a web browser or tools like curl, ensuring the correct host header is used.
This lecture sets the stage for understanding how to configure and test ingress routing in Kubernetes.

<!--                 test the ingress routing configuration?                 -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

You can test the ingress routing configuration in a few ways:

Web Browser:

Use the configured host name (e.g., hello.example.com) in the browser's address bar. Ensure that the DNS resolution is set up correctly.
Curl Command:

Use the curl command in the terminal to send a request. For example:
curl -H "Host: hello.example.com" http://<ingress-controller-ip>/login
Replace <ingress-controller-ip> with the actual IP address of your ingress controller.
Host Header:
If DNS is not set up, you can specify the host header directly in your request using tools like curl, as shown above.
These methods will help you verify that the ingress routing is functioning as expected.

<!--     Challenges when using ingress routing in a complex application?     -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

When using ingress routing in a complex application, several challenges may arise:

Configuration Complexity:

Managing multiple ingress resources and rules can become complicated, especially with numerous services and paths.
Path Conflicts:

Overlapping paths or hostnames can lead to routing conflicts, making it difficult to determine which service should handle a request.
Security Concerns:

Ensuring secure communication (e.g., TLS/SSL) can be challenging, especially when dealing with multiple domains and certificates.
Performance Issues:

Ingress controllers can become bottlenecks if not properly scaled, leading to latency or downtime during high traffic.
Monitoring and Debugging:

Troubleshooting issues with ingress routing can be difficult due to the abstraction layer it introduces, requiring additional monitoring tools.
DNS Management:
Properly configuring DNS entries for multiple services can be complex, especially in dynamic environments.
Addressing these challenges often requires careful planning, monitoring, and possibly the use of additional tools or services.
